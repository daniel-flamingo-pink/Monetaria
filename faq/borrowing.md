# Borrowing

In Monetaria, borrowing refers to the act of obtaining liquidity (or working capital) by taking out a loan using your assets as collateral. This allows you to access funds without selling your assets and potentially losing out on potential value gains. Borrowing also allows you to leverage your holdings or take advantage of new investment opportunities.

To borrow, you will need to deposit an accepted asset as collateral, and the maximum amount you can borrow will depend on the value of the collateral you have deposited and the available liquidity. Borrowing rates are determined by the supply and demand of the asset you wish to borrow. You can choose between a stable or variable interest rate, and you can switch between the two at any time through your dashboard.

**Interest is added to your loan on a per-slot basis, so the amount you have to repay will increase over time.** You can repay your loan at any time, and you will need to repay it in the same asset you borrowed. **There may be minting fees associated with taking out a loan, which will be added to your debt at the time of minting.**

In summary:

* Borrowing allows you to access liquidity without selling your assets
* You will need to deposit collateral to borrow
* The maximum amount you can borrow depends on the value of your collateral and the available liquidity
* You can choose between a stable or variable interest rate, and switch between the two at any time
* **Interest is added to your loan over time, and you can repay your loan at any time**
* **You will need to repay your loan in the same asset you borrowed, and there may be minting fees associated with taking out the loan.**

A total of 57.5% of the total supply of MNT tokens (575,000,000 out of 1,000,000,000) will be distributed through liquidity mining incentive programs and various community programs. The first liquidity mining initiative (LMI-0) will be available to the borrowing pool, lending pool, and liquidity providers.

## Types of Interest Rates in Monetaria

In Monetaria, there are two types of interest rates available for borrowing: stable and variable.

### Stable Rate

A stable rate acts as a fixed rate in the short term, but it can be rebalanced in the long term in response to changes in market conditions. The stable rate, as its name indicates, will remain fairly stable and is the best option for planning how much interest you will have to pay.

### Variable Rate

A variable rate is based on the supply and demand in Monetaria. It will change over time and may be the optimal rate depending on market conditions. You can switch between the stable and variable rate at any time through your dashboard.

## Stable Rate Rebalance

Your stable rate may be rebalanced if the average borrow rate is lower than 25% APY and the utilization rate is over 95%. This is expected to be unlikely, but it is possible.

## Switching Interest Rate Types

To switch between stable and variable interest rate types, simply browse to your dashboard and click on the “APR Type” switch button for the asset you wish to apply the rate change to.

## Interest Rate on Borrowed Assets

The interest rate you pay for borrowing assets depends on the borrowing rate, which is derived from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. The interest rate of a variable rate changes constantly, while a stable interest rate provides stability for the interest rates. You can find your current borrowing rate at any time in the Borrowings section of your dashboard.

## Borrowing in Monetaria

In Monetaria, you may want to borrow assets for a variety of reasons. By borrowing, you can **obtain liquidity (or working capital) without selling your assets**. This allows you to access funds without closing your position on an asset and potentially losing out on potential value gains. Users may borrow for unexpected expenses, to leverage their holdings, or to take advantage of new investment opportunities.

### Requirements for Borrowing

To borrow in Monetaria, you will first need to **deposit an accepted asset as collateral**. Ensure that the "Use as Collateral" tab is enabled in the "Supply" section.

### Maximum Borrowing Amount

The maximum amount you can borrow depends on the value of the collateral you have deposited and the available liquidity. You **cannot borrow an asset if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor does not permit it**.

The maximum amount you can borrow will depend on the value of the collateral you have deposited and the available liquidity. For example, if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor does not allow it, you may not be able to borrow an asset. You can find every available collateral and its specific borrowing parameters in the **risk parameters section**.

## Minting Fees

All loans on Monetaria are subject to a **minting fee** that varies by vault. This fee is added to a user's debt at the time of minting, and is not recurring. For example, if a user borrows 100 USDT against ETH, their debt will be 100.5 USDH, accounting for the 0.5% minting fee applied to the DeFi Treasury vault.

### Repaying Your Loan

You **repay your loan on the same asset you borrowed**. For example, if you borrow 5 USDT you will pay back 5 USDT + interest accrued. The repayments tab is located under the "Borrow" dashboard. To make a repayment, click on REPAY, enter your desired amount to repay, and confirm your transaction. Repayments can only be done with the same asset that was borrowed.

### The Health Factor

The **health factor** is the numeric representation of the safety of your deposited assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. The higher the value is, the safer the state of your funds are against a liquidation scenario. If the health factor reaches 1, the liquidation of your deposits will be triggered. A health factor below 1 can also result in liquidation. For a HF=2, the collateral value vs borrow can reduce by 1 out of 2: 50%. The health factor depends on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against the value of your borrowed funds.

### Avoiding Liquidation

If your health factor decreases, the risk of liquidation increases. In order to avoid liquidation, you can **repay your loan or deposit more assets** to increase your health factor. Repaying the loan will increase your health factor more than depositing additional assets.
