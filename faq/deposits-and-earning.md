# Deposits & Earning

Users who provide assets can receive an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) from the users who borrow. The borrow APY is spread across the entirety of the pool, which means that the supply APY is equivalent to the Borrow APY multiplied by the utilization rate.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if a pool holds two Ether and one Ether is lent out at a 20% APY, users who provided both Ether will receive 10% APY each.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This APY is provided in the same token as the supply; for example, ETH for ETH yield or USDT for USDT yield. This is because the APY on loans is also charged in the same yield. The displayed APY is based on the compound interest rate for each year.&#x20;

## **Additional Liquidity Mining Rewards.**

Further, users can benefit from Liquidity Mining rewards; \
575,000,000 MNT tokens (out of a total supply of 1,000,000,000 MNT tokens) or 57.5% of all MNT tokens will be distributed via Liquidity Mining incentives and various community programs.&#x20;

The first Liquidity Mining Initiative (LMI-0) will be accessible to those in the Borrowing Pool, Lending Pool, and Liquidity Providers.&#x20;

## How To Deposit?

In order to deposit assets, users should click on the “Pools” tab in the menu and select an asset type from the list before clicking “Supply”.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
They should then input how much they would like to deposit and submit the transaction.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Upon confirmation of this transaction, their deposit will be successfully registered and they will begin receiving interest. First deposits of single assets require an additional approval transaction but there are no minimum or maximum deposits imposed; users can deposit any amount.&#x20;

## How To Withdraw?

When withdrawing assets, user should click on the Dashboard tab in the menu before selecting an asset type from the list and pressing withdrawal button associated with that asset.&#x20;

They should then select how much they would like to withdraw before submitting the transaction. Alternatively they can use their “aTokens” as liquidity without needing to withdraw them.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
However they should ensure that there is enough liquidity (not borrowed) available for withdrawal.
{% endhint %}

If not they will need to wait for additional liquidity from depositors or borrowers before withdrawal can be completed.&#x20;

## How to exclude my asset from being used as collateral?

Finally, users with multiple deposited assets have the ability to choose which assets are used as collateral by simply toggling on/off the “use as collateral” button located on their preferred asset in the “Supply” dashboard.
