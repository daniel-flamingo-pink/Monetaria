# Wallet Connect

### What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that enables **interactions between your wallet and other DApps**. By scanning a QR code or clicking a deep link, WalletConnect establishes an encrypted connection between your wallet and the DApp. The protocol also has push notification capabilities to notify users of incoming transactions. Some popular mobile wallets that support WalletConnect include \[wallet name] and \[wallet name]. You can find a list of WalletConnect-supported wallets [here](https://docs.walletconnect.com/).
