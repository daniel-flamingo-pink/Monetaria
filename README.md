# Introduction

## What is Monetaria?

Monetaria is a **decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol** __ that enables users to earn passive yield, access instant backed loans, and participate in a cross-chain money market. The protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts designed to **prioritize censorship resistance, security, and self-sufficiency**.&#x20;

It provides an automated marketplace where lenders deposit assets into Monetaria liquidity pools to earn interest rates, borrowers borrow assets from the pools using their deposited assets as collateral, and flash loans are available for uncollateralized loans. The protocol is owned and governed by MNT token holders.

## Why Monetaria?

To begin, it is necessary to delineate the various components of the Monetaria Protocol, so that new users do not become confused.&#x20;

Monetaria is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that enables users to partake as providers, lenders or liquidators in a cross-chain money market for passive yield and access to instant backed loans. It is a public good owned and governed by MNT token holders.&#x20;

The participants of the Monetaria Protocol are as follows:&#x20;

* Lenders who deposit assets into Monetaria liquidity pools to earn an interest rate;&#x20;
* Borrowers who borrow assets from Monetaria liquidity pools using their deposited assets as collateral;&#x20;
* Flash loan users who take out uncollateralized loans without borrowing limits but must return them within the same transaction or risk their loan being cancelled by a smart contract.&#x20;

The protocol has been designed with the goal of **prioritizing censorship resistance, security, self-sufficiency and unrestricted access without any reliance on trusted third parties.**&#x20;

We aspire to leverage this vision to create a leading Decentralized Finance (DeFi) credit protocol, becoming the go-to creditor for both individuals and dApps. Moreover, we invite teams across the space to join us in contributing to this mission.
