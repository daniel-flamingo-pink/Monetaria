# Moneta (MNT) Tokenomics

### Introduction

The Moneta Token (MNT) is the governance token for the Monetaria Protocol. MNT holders can participate in governance by creating and voting on polls by staking their MNT. MNT is also a functional utility token that will be used for exchange between participants on Monetaria.io in a decentralized manner. The main purposes of MNT are to incentivize liquidity providers on the Monetaria Finance platform and to involve as many users as possible in the governance of the protocol.

### Supply

A total supply of 1 billion MNT tokens will be distributed over a period of at least 4 years. Once this total supply is distributed, there will be no more new MNT tokens introduced to the supply. The distribution of the initial supply of approximately 430.00M (\~43%) is as follows:

* 5% to pre-MNT liquidity providers with 2 year vesting
* 30% to shareholders (team and investors + NFTs) with 3-4 year vesting
* 3% to employees with 4 year vesting
* 8% to the community reserve

The remaining supply of approximately 570.00M (\~57%) will be distributed as follows:

* 59% to community liquidity providers
* 30% to shareholders (team and investors + NFTs) with 2-4 year vesting
* 3% to employees with 4 year vesting
* 8% to the community reserve

The circulating supply will be 0 at launch and the initial release rate will be around 500k MNT per day.
