# Staking & Unstaking

### Overview

Moneta (MNT) holders who wish to participate in governance can stake their MNT tokens, with an unstaking period of 21 days and 4 hours. Moneta has a few key properties:

* **Governance**: 1 MNT = 1 unit of voting power. Only MNT that’s locked for Monetaria Joint Venture contributors can participate in governance, making decisions on asset listing, risk parameters, treasury spending and more.
* **Fees**: Moneta (MNT) token holders receive a share of protocol interest-rate revenue.
* **Safety Module**: MNT holders backstop protocol risk. A pool of reserved MNT (the ‘Safety Module’) is used as a first-resort source of recovery for shortfall events. Staked MNT is used as a last-resort source of recovery for Shortfall Events, with up to 30% of their stake being locked and sold in case of a shortfall event.

### How to Stake MNT

To stake MNT, follow this link: [https://app.monetaria.io/stake](https://app.monetaria.io/stake). You can stake your MNT by connecting your wallet, entering the desired amount of MNT to stake, and approving the transaction on your digital wallet.

### How to Unstake MNT

To unstake MNT, follow this link: [https://app.monetaria.io/stake](https://app.monetaria.io/stake). You can unstake your MNT by connecting your wallet, entering the desired amount of MNT to unstake, and clicking on "Unstake." Your request will be shown in the Unstake Requests tab.

### Freezing Period

The freezing period is the time required prior to unstaking your tokens. You must start the freezing period before you can unstake your tokens. You can start the freezing period by going to the staking section, selecting "unstake," and clicking on "activate freezing." It will require one transaction to be sent.

The freezing period by default is 21 days, but this can be further extended by the governance.

**IMPORTANT**: After the freezing period is complete, you have a 2 day window where you can unstake. If you do not unstake during that period, you will have to start the freezing process over again.

Example:

* If the freezing period was activated 21 days and 4 hours ago, you can unstake.
* If the freezing period was activated 23 days and 4 hours ago, you cannot unstake, and you will need to start the 21 day freezing period again.

### Claiming Rewards

You can claim your rewards at any time by going to the staking section and clicking on "Claim." The MNT tokens from the reward will be in your connected wallet as soon as the transaction is confirmed.
